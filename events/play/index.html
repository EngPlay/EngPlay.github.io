                <!-- Acquaintances Sid and Aliyah get stuck on Goldenhawk Island together. After a grad trip to the island, Aliyah is accidentally left behind with Sid, who decided to stay on the island a little longer by himself. Their friends Grace and Britney try and get them both back with the help of their friends Bjorn, Chad, and Jacob. They are left with no option but to enlist the help of Britney's incredibly old-fashioned uncle Donnie.    -->
                <!--"A series of vignettes about raging hormones, inane fights, and first love all revolving around lunch period in this hilarious and heartwarming rock/grunge musical that reminds us just what middle school is all about. From Kelly, the most popular girl in school, to Mophead, the free-spirited lead singer of the school's own punk band, to Misty, the depressed outsider who always sits alone, everyone is preoccupied with improving their social status -- particularly with the all-important Annual Eighth Grade Dinner Dance looming in the near future."-->
						    <!-- Three friends lock themselves away for a week to study for their engineering finals, only to discover the world has dramatically changed in their absence. A super-intelligent AI has gained sentience, and solved all the world's problems. When engineers as we know it are obsolete, what next? As these three friends go on a wild and hilarious journey to meet the enigmatic AI, they are left with one question: The world has changed, but can they? -->
						    <!-- In a world where a super intelligent AI has completely decimated the notion of a STEM based economy, three engineering students come to grips with their radically changing surroundings as they go on a quest to visit and talk to the AI. -->
						    <!-- Three engineering students - Austin, Bob, and Claire - lock themselves in an apartment, shut off from the world, to study for exams. When they emerge to restock on food, they come to find that the technological singularity has occurred and an AI now rules the planet. This artificial super-intelligence has solved STEM, making most engineers obsolete, and now the world operates on an Emotions/Arts based economy. When the three discover that it is actually possible to visit the AI's headquarters and meet him, at a very steep cost, they embark on a journey to gather enough "wealth" so that they may meet and face the planet's ruler.

						   Along the way, they face many challenges, both physical and mental as they come to terms with the world around them and what it means for their futures. -->
