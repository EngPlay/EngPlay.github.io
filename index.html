							EngPlay is a termly theatre production put on by the University of Waterloo Engineering Society. With auditions open to anyone and everyone (we’ve even had a student from the Math faculty as cast, and then a director!), the play changes frequently in both scope and topic. Some shows have been written by the directors for the term, while other shows have been purchased scripts from professional playwrights. There has been the occassional musical, but all EngPlay's share a common theme: laughter. We love goofing around and having a good time and getting people to join in on the fun with us. The production can change drastically from night to night based on improv, audience interaction, and last-minute plot twists. EngPlay is a tradition shared amongst many schools, and one that sits close to Waterloo’s heart.

							Waterloo EngPlay displays the vast variety of skills possessed by our engineering students (and other UW students!). At the beginning of each school term, the cast is chosen, and then over a period of 10 weeks the show comes together! We act, we laugh, we cry, we build sets, we laugh some more, we do a little more acting, and finally laugh again. EngPlay is never a dull a moment and we'd love to have you come and <a href="events/play/index.html">check out a show!</a>
