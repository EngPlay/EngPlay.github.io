# EngPlay.github.io
Website for the Engplay

This repository is intended to include all the code and assets for each EngPlay. The intent is to pass the EngPlay account on to the next society after each term, so that the uwengplay.com website can be used as a central place for all people to get info on EngPlay/buy tickets/watch shows. 


To contribute code, contact the EngPlay directors or EngSoc.   

Current A-SOC Directors: Reed Rogers, Greg Sinclair

Current B-SOC Directors: Noah Abradjian, James Liu
